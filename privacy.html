		<p>
			<b>Collection and Use of Personal Information</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			StreamView App collects and stores personal information or non-personal information that users provided while using StreamView App. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<b>What Information We Collect</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To enable certain features, StreamView App will get user’s mobile devices’ several permissions, including access to camera, access to your device’s microphone, access to device storage, access to your Google account information, access to device login information, access to your email login information, access to your WiFi router or hotspot information, and access to your network status. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Here are some examples of the types of personal information StreamView App may collect and how we may use it:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			1. When you are configuring motion notification and alert via app push notification on StreamView mobile App, StreamView App will collect your Google account information provided by you to complete push notification configuration.</br>
		</p>

		<p>
			2. When you are configuring motion alert via e-mail on StreamView App, StreamView App will require you to provide your email account information, including your email server, account, and password to complete email alert configuration.</br>
		</p>

		<p>
			3. StreamView App will remember some information when you use our applications. For example, automatically remembering your passwords for accessing StreamView App will offer user authentication when accessing StreamView App next time, which helps increase data security and data privacy. </br>
		</p>

		<p>
			4. StreamView App will automatically remember your passwords for devices login when you change default login password (strongly recommend for security consideration) to a new one will enable you to log in cameras easily next time.</br>
		</p>

		<p>
			5. When you are configuring Wi-Fi setting of WiFi-enabled security cameras on StreamView App, StreamView App will get access to your Wi-Fi router information and Wi-Fi password to enable WiFi-enabled security cameras to work wireless without connection to Ethernet cable as well as being accessed remotely.</br>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<b>How We Use Your Personal & Non-Personal Information</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The personal and non-personal information we collect allow users to access StreamView App, verify the user, configure security cameras, get access to security cameras functions and features, and guarantee and secure user information while using StreamView App. </br>
			We may also require users’ personal information for technical support such as troubleshooting, data analysis, and research to improve its products, services, and customer communications.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Retention of Personal & Non-Personal Information</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			We will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the application. Please note that some or all of the User Provided Data may be required in order for the application to function properly.</br>
			We will not sell, share, or rent the collected information to any third party or use it for any illegal activities.
		</p>

		<p>
